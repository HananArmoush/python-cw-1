# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
x1=6
x2=2
print(x1+x2)
# Write a print statement that uses the division operator / 
print(x1/x2)
# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *
print(x1*x2)
# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
lenght=163
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width=56
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
area=lenght*width
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
print(f'The result is {area}')

# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables. 
print(f"if the lenght is {lenght}, and width is {width},, then the area is{area}")
